/**
 * A composable function that measures the height of its content when it's not yet visible
 * and dynamically reserves space for it. This ensures smooth animations when the content
 * becomes visible, as the layout doesn't need to adjust to the content's size.

 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the layout.
 * @param showContent Whether the content should be visible.
 * @param content The composable content to be measured and displayed.
